# HacoPs
Hahndorf's awesome collection of PowerShell scripts. 

Just a a bunch of random PowerShell scripts I wrote over time.

Nothing fancy here.

### Update-LECertificate.ps1

Meta script which uses some other PowerShell scripts and modules to update all Let's Encrypt certificates on a Windows Server.

### Set-NetworkProfileCategory.ps1

 In 'Network and Sharing Center' your networks are shown as 'Public', "Private' or 'Domain'
    You can change that with this script in all supported versions of Windows
    
### New-DemoFtpSite.ps1

Shows how to set up IIS with a FTP site that uses IIS Manager Users
and a special account to run the FTP service.
